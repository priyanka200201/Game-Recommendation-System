# Game Recommendation System

Welcome to the Game Recommendation System repository! This project features a recommendation system for games, leveraging Steam datasets including User and Game datasets. Utilizing Python along with various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this recommendation system provides efficient data analysis and insightful recommendations for Steam users.

## Features

- **Efficient Data Analysis**: Utilize Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for efficient processing and interpretation of Steam datasets.

- **Visualizations**: Employ visualizations including histograms and box plots to communicate complex data distributions and playing habits effectively.

- **Collaborative Filtering Algorithms**: Implement recommendation algorithms such as collaborative filtering with ALS, EM, and SVD to generate personalized game recommendations for users.

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Implement content-based filtering to recommend games based on user preferences and game attributes.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Primary programming language used for data analysis and recommendation system development.
  - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Utilized for interactive data analysis and documentation.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implemented collaborative filtering algorithms (ALS, EM, SVD) and content-based filtering for recommendation generation.

## Getting Started

To explore the Game Recommendation System project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Game-Recommendation-System.git
   ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: Navigate to the cloned repository directory and open the Jupyter Notebook file (`game-recommendation-system.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook.

3. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells in the Jupyter Notebook to load and analyze the Steam datasets, implement recommendation algorithms, and generate game recommendations.

4. **Explore Recommendations**: Once the notebook execution is complete, explore the generated game recommendations for Steam users based on collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms.

5. **Customize and Extend**: Feel free to customize the recommendation system or extend its functionality according to your specific requirements. Modify algorithms, experiment with different parameters, or integrate additional datasets as needed.

6. **Feedback and Contributions**: If you have any feedback or suggestions for improving the recommendation system, or if you'd like to contribute enhancements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of what you can do with the Game Recommendation System:

- Generate personalized game recommendations for individual Steam users based on their playing habits and preferences.
- Compare the effectiveness of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms in generating relevant recommendations.
- Explore the impact of different algorithm parameters on recommendation quality and performance.
